# Discord Chrome Extension for Animations
This chrome extension allows for user to make their Profile Picture a GIF, to update their Banner to a Custom Image (or GIF), and allows them to change the color of their popout animations colors.
This is all done through DOM manipulation and injecting new CSS properites into the existing DOM Structure and is client side only.
